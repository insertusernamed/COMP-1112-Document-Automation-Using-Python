# Flow Control

## Overview

This module dives deeper into flow control in Python, including detailed examples of if-else statements, loops, and control flow techniques.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand and use if-else statements.
-   Learn to use for and while loops.
-   Master control flow techniques to manage the execution of code.

## Key Concepts

-   **If-Else Statements**: Conditional statements that execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
-   **Loops**: Constructs that repeat a block of code multiple times.
    -   **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence of elements.
    -   **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.

## Code Examples

### If-Else Statements

The following Python script demonstrates the use of if-else statements.

#### `if_statements.py`

This script covers:

-   Basic if-else structure
-   Nested if-else statements
-   Elif ladder

### Loops

The following Python script demonstrates the use of loops.

#### `loops.py`

This script covers:

-   For loops
-   While loops
-   Nested loops

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute the following commands:

```
python if_statements.py
```

```
python loops.py
```
