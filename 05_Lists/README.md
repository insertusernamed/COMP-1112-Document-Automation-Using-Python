# Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

## Overview

This module provides a detailed exploration of Python's core data structures: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It covers how to create, access, modify, and use these data structures effectively.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the characteristics and uses of lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
-   Learn how to create and manipulate these data structures.
-   Explore common methods and operations for each data structure.

## Key Concepts

-   **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
-   **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
-   **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

## Code Examples

### Lists

The following Python script demonstrates the use of lists.

#### `lists.py`

This script covers:

-   Creating and accessing list elements
-   Common list operations and methods

### Tuples

The following Python script demonstrates the use of tuples.

#### `tuples.py`

This script covers:

-   Creating and accessing tuple elements
-   Common tuple operations

### Dictionaries

The following Python script demonstrates the use of dictionaries.

#### `dictionaries.py`

This script covers:

-   Creating and accessing dictionary elements
-   Common dictionary operations and methods

## Running the Examples
