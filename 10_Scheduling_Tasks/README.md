# Scheduling Tasks and Launching Programs

## Overview

This module provides an introduction to scheduling tasks and launching programs in Python. It covers how to use the `schedule` library for task scheduling and the `subprocess` module for launching external programs.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand how to schedule tasks in Python using the `schedule` library.
-   Learn how to launch external programs using the `subprocess` module.

## Key Concepts

-   **Task Scheduling**: Automating the execution of tasks at specified intervals.
-   **Subprocess Module**: A module that allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

## Code Examples

### Scheduling Tasks

The following script demonstrates how to schedule tasks using the `schedule` library.

#### `task_scheduler.py`

This script covers:

-   Installing the `schedule` library
-   Scheduling tasks to run at specific times
-   Running the scheduled tasks

### Launching Programs

The following script demonstrates how to launch external programs using the `subprocess` module.

#### `launch_programs.py`

This script covers:

-   Running simple commands
-   Launching programs and Shell commands

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute the following commands:
